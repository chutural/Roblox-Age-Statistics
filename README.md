# Roblox Statistics

## BEFORE OPENING
Make sure you have **Python 3.1 or above** and **matplotlib**.

### If you don't have Python:
Download from here:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### If you don't have matplotlib:
Open CMD and type in:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```


## To start the app:
1. Double-click `start_app.bat`.
2. Make sure all files are in this exact directory.
3. The application will open.

## How to use the Statistics:
Type an age on the top and then check if they have Voice Chat.

If they have VC, press **Add (w/ VC)**. If not, press **Add (w/o VC)**.

**Statistics** will show stuff and the **Log** will show the ages you have typed, if they have VC, and the timestamp when you added it.

**Save Data** will save your list to *data/roblox_players.csv* which shows Age, Players, VCE (Voice Chat Enabled), and VCD (Voice Chat Disabled) with the amount of them which you can use to make a statistics (I actually don't know how to do more)

**Generate Charts** makes 2 Charts from the age you have collected and saves them to the *charts/* Folder. Player Age Distribution (Age Group) and Voice Chat Usage. (I don't know what else to make other than those 2)

## NOTE:
This is only used for my research purposes to determine how old the Roblox players are and whether they have voice chat enabled or disabled. This application only serves the purpose of collecting their age and voice chat option (if the game has a voice chat icon on top of their username or by checking the player list) and using them for a chart. The results will help in understanding the demographics of the Roblox community and how voice chat features are used among different age groups. The data could also show the overall gaming experience and social interactions within the Roblox platform.

## MY EXPERIENCES CODING THIS:
I got bored, so I got curious and decided to code this in like 2 hours and use it in booth experience games like Rate My Avatar 2, Booth Game, and similar games. I'm actually running out of things to say in this part. I wanted to know how old they are and if they have voice chat.

Also the code is so garbage, I know. I'm kind of new at this coding language but this is the best I can do.
